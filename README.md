# GenAI Application Testing 

This GitHub branch specifically checks the integration between your application and the model runner. It performs several key testing operations:

- Environment Setup Testing: It verifies that Testcontainers could successfully set up the required environment, including creating and configuring a socat container for networking.
- API Endpoint Testing: It tests various endpoints of the model runner service:
   - Checks the /models endpoint (to list available models)
   - Tests the /engines endpoint (to verify the service was running)
- Model Creation Testing: It attempts to create a model (as an optional test) and verified this operation was successful.
- Connectivity Testing: The test verified that the model runner was accessible at a specific URL and provided the correct configuration URL to use in the application.

This type of testing is crucial for GenAI applications because it ensures that:

- The infrastructure components (containers, networking) work correctly
- The model service is properly configured and responding
- Basic model operations (like model loading/creation) function as expected

Why testcontainers? The approach implemented with Testcontainers is particularly valuable for GenAI testing because it provides an isolated, reproducible environment that can be used across development, testing, and CI/CD workflows, ensuring consistent behavior of your GenAI application regardless of where it runs.

Here's a breakdown of what's happening:

- Test Initialization:
  - The test connects to your Docker environment (Docker Desktop version 28.0.2)
  - It reports memory (9937 MB) and connection details
  - A unique test session ID is generated to track this test run

- Container Setup:
   - Ryuk Container: First, a container using the testcontainers/ryuk:0.6.0 image is created and started. Ryuk is a cleanup service that ensures containers are removed when tests complete, even if they terminate unexpectedly.
   - Socat Container: Then, an alpine/socat container is created and started. This container acts as a network proxy, forwarding traffic between your tests and the model runner service.

- Testing Process:
    - Models Endpoint: The test checks the /models endpoint and reports that 0 models were found.
    - Engines Endpoint: The test verifies the /engines endpoint is responding with "Docker Model Runner The service is running."
    - Model Creation: The test attempts to create a model and reports success.


- Test Completion:
   - The test passes successfully (in 7.80 seconds)
   - The socat container is terminated
   - The test provides important URL information:
   - Model Runner is accessible via: http://127.0.0.1:55536
   - Use this URL in your application config: http://127.0.0.1:55536/engines/llama.cpp/v1
